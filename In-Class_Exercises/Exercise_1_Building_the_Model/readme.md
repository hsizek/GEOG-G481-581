## Exercise 1: Building a simple two pool carbon cycle model

In today's exercise we'll be learning how to build a simple two pool C model.

The course notes for these exercises can be found in this directory: https://github.com/nmacbean/GEOG-G481-581/tree/master/In-Class_Exercises/Exercise_1_Building_the_Model

We will also go through the introduction to the simple C cycle model we're building here: https://github.com/nmacbean/GEOG-G481-581/blob/master/In-Class_Exercises/Introduction_to_the_simple_C_model.md

We will be working in Python in a Jupyter Notebook. We will load Jupyter Notebook on the IU research desktop.

1. To load the IU research desktop, go to https://red.uits.iu.edu/main/.
2. Open the terminal.

On the command line, type:

[FIRST TIME ONLY] \>> git clone https://github.com/nmacbean/GEOG-G481-581

\>> cd GEOG-G481-581

\>> git pull

\>> module load anaconda

\>> cd In-Class_Exercises/Exercise_1_Building_the_Model/

\>> jupyter notebook

This will open a Mozilla Firefox window with the jupyter directory. Click on "Exercise_1_Building_the_Model.ipynb" to open the jupyter notebook for this exericse.

**Once you have finished the exercise, make sure you save the Jupyter Notebook with your name in the file name (e.g. Exercise_1_Building_the_Model_nmacbean.ipynb) and then upload it directly to Canvas on RED.** I will show you an example of how to do this during class.
 
This we will go through the exercise together and there will be time to do the exercises and answer questions. We will also be learning some basic python coding to perform the tasks we want to accomplish. 
 
Please complete all the exercises within the notebook and answer all the questions before uploading to Canvas.
