## Exercise 4: Data Assimilation

In today's class we'll be learning (via a short powerpoint presentation) about data assimilation (DA), which refers to a set of statistical techniques for using data to quantify and reduce uncertainty in model predictions. In this case, we are using DA as a tool to optimize the parameters in the model. We will discuss and analyze some results of DA experiments during class, and then you will complete a quiz on Canvas to test your understanding of what we have learned and discussed in class today. Please complete the quiz on Canvas by the deadline.

EXTRA: if you would like analyse some additional DA experimental results to better understand how DA works, check out the "Exercise_4_EXTRA_Data_Assimilation.docx" worksheet in this Github folder. The answers will be posted after the deadline for Exercise 4.

You can find the powerpoint presentation, the experiment results you need to analyze and the problem sheet word document in this directory on the GitHub Course Page: https://github.com/nmacbean/GEOG-G481-581/tree/master/In-Class_Exercises/Exercise_4_Data_Assimilation
