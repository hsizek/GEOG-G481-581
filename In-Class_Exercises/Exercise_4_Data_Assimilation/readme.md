## Exercise 4: Data Assimilation

In today's class we'll be learning (via a short powerpoint presentation) about data assimilation (DA), which refers to a set of statistical techniques for using data to quantify and reduce uncertainty in model predictions. You will then be analysing some DA experimental results to better understand how DA works.

You can find the powerpoint presentation, the experiment results you need to analyze and the problem sheet in this directory on the GitHub Course Page: https://github.com/nmacbean/GEOG-G481-581/tree/master/In-Class_Exercises/Exercise_4_Data_Assimilation

Please complete the problem set and upload your answers to Canvas by the deadline.
