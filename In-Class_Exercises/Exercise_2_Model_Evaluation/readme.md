## Exercise 2: Model Evaluation

In today's exercise we'll be performing a preliminary model evaluation - i.e. comparing the model to observations.

The steps for opening the jupyter notebook for this exercise are as follows:

1. Log into red: https://red.uits.iu.edu/main/ 

2. Open the terminal window.

On the command line, type:

3. cd GEOG-G481-581/
4. git pull
5. In-Class_Exercises/Exercise_2_Model_Evaluation/
6. module load anaconda
7. jupyter notebook

This will open a Mozilla Firefox window with the jupyter directory. Click on "Exercise_2_Model_Evaluation.ipynb" to open the jupyter notebook for this exericse.

**Once you have finished the exercise, make sure you save the Jupyter Notebook with your name in the file name (e.g. Exercise_2_Model_Evaluation_nmacbean.ipynb) and then upload it directly to Canvas on RED.**

Please complete the questions and exercises in the Jupyter Notebook and upload it to Canvas by the deadline.
