## Exercise 3: Model Sensitivity

In today's exercise we'll be exploring how model sensitivity analysis can be used to understand the behavior of our model as well as how it can be used to test hypotheses of how ecosystem functioning (e.g. carbon cycling) might respond to climate change and rising CO2.

The steps for opening the jupyter notebook for this exercise are as follows:

1. Log into red: https://red.uits.iu.edu/main/

2. Open the terminal window.

On the command line, type:

3. cd GEOG-G481-581/
4. git pull
5. In-Class_Exercises/Exercise_3_Model_Sensitivity/
6. module load anaconda
7. jupyter notebook

This will open a Mozilla Firefox window with the jupyter directory. Click on "Exercise_3_Model_Sensitivity.ipynb" to open the jupyter notebook for this exericse.

Once you have finished the exercise, make sure you **save** the Jupyter Notebook **with your name** in the file name (e.g. Exercise_3_Model_Sensitivity_nmacbean.ipynb) and then upload it directly to Canvas on RED.

Please complete the questions and exercises in the Jupyter Notebook and upload it to Canvas by the deadline.
