In today's exercise we'll be learning how to build a simple two pool C model.

The course notes for these exercises can be found in this directory: https://github.com/nmacbean/GEOG-G440-540/tree/master/In-Class%20Exercises/Exercise%201%20Building%20the%20Model

We'll be working in Python in a Jupyter Notebook. Please download the jupyter notebook we will be working in and the input data file.

We will load Jupyter Notebook using Git Bash on the STC computers. Search for Git Bash and open it up.

On the command line prompt, type "jupyter notebook" and the JupyterNotebook server will load.
 
Today we will go through the exercise together and there will be time to do the exercises and answer questions. We will also be learning some basic python coding to perform the tasks we want to accomplish. 
 
Please complete all the exercises within the notebook and answer all the questions before uploading to Canvas.
