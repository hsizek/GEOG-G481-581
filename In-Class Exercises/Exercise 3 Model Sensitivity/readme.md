## Exercise 3: Model Sensitivity

In today's exercise we'll be exploring how model sensitivity analysis can be used to understand the behavior of our model as well as how it can be used to test hypotheses of how ecosystem functioning (e.g. carbon cycling) might respond to climate change and rising CO2.

You will need to download the Jupyter Notebook for the exercise,the input file here, *and* the separate model script. 

All the files can also be found on the GitHub course page: 

Complete the questions and exercises in the Jupyter Notebook and upload it to Canvas by the deadline. 

REMEMBER: save your Jupyter Notebook before you log off the SB 221 computers!
